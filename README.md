## Attribution
This work is forked form https://github.com/mleitwein/epigenetics_multifactor_workflow,  
which in turn was forked from https://github.com/jleluyer/epigenetics_multifactor_workflow.

The majority of code thus originated from the work of Jérémy Leluyer (https://github.com/jleluyer) and modifications made by Maëva Leitwein (https://github.com/mleitwein)

The remaining changes were made mostly by Eric Normandeau (https://github.com/enormandeau) in Louis Bernatchez' lab (http://www2.bio.ulaval.ca/louisbernatchez/presentation.htm)
